VS Code can now automatically update import paths when you move or rename a #typescript or #javascript file. Try it out in the latest @code insiders

And thank the @typescriptlang team for adding thispic.twitter.com/Yn6gvCIq18

Which version supports this feature, I have 1.23.1 on windows, nothin happens 

Insiders right now:https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/ 

@DawsonBotsford thought this might be interesting for you!

So good! Haven’t seen this. I’ve hoped for this feature forever, and it shouldn’t have to be for just TypeScript. Here’s hoping it comes to generic js one day  

Works for js too

That is an ugly amount of buttons though, could we not show one of the options as a checkbox instead of button? I guess that needs new API...

That's nice. At some point VSCode is going to start outperforming Webstorm in stuff like this

IMO it did already, I payed for WebStorm for the past 3 years.. knew all the shorcuts, used all the features... and I am done, VS Code outperforms it

Me and some colleagues tried out both (where they were vscode fans and I was a Webstorm guy) - we ended up with ws, primarily because the refactorings were better

F2 work really well now, and I see thay are supporting drag and drop file change now, I think they are pretty close to be on par with WebStorm refactoring

Yeah I agree. It definitely seems like they're rapidly gaining momentum.

Wow, that is one of the last major hurdles I have with @code ! Nice job!

@anymaniax alright alright im gonna give it a try

Finally ! :)

Time to delete WS

Maybe Visual studio standard will natively soon support namespace renaming...

Interesting, I don't see this update in insiders

Ahh I see it requires Typescript 2.9
