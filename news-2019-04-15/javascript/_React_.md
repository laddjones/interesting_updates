We're relicensing React Native (including Fresco, Metro, and Yoga) under the MIT license to match React.https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/26684cf3adf4094eb6c405d345a75bf8c7c0bf88 …

But wait, how does this announcement feel? I must know!

Do you mean how we feel to announce it?

Yes, which emoji best captures your emotional state?

Yes moar emoji  take notes

I’m hopeful Facebook will also include a patent grant. Implied patent grants are legally very dubious, and if developers understood they’re in a far worse position now than before, there would be another uproar. Bottom line: don’t patent open source.

I'm really not qualified to talk about licensing, but I wonder why MIT was chosen rather than Apache, as Apache contains a patent grant.

Because MIT is the norm within the JS community.

Sure, but most JS libraries don't need to deal with potential patent issues.

Why did I misread that as "parent issues" twice in a row?

Thank you

Thank you so much!! This sooo interesting  Is there any announcement / article on this? Would be fun to read

What I like about this is that Facebook isn’t putting themselves in a super position anymore where they can violate patent rights of other companies without fear of being sued - because those companies would then first have to replace any dependency to RN. Awesome 

@reactjs will you relicense ReactVR also?

That's awesome 

Finally! It was the one thing preventing me from starting up a long term project with react native..

Best news I’ve heard all week!

Nice!
